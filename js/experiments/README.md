This subdirectory is for small experiments with HTML5 and JavaScript features.

Among the things you may find here is some code that was checking out
the HTML5 "file writing" API to see if we could get it to work in the 
browsers we were using.  

My recollection is "no", but we're keeping the code anyway--who knows,
at a later date maybe the browsers will catch up.
